Repository for a the Deep Learning academic Project . The goal is to **train a network for playing the game of Go**. The number of parameters for the networks must be lower than 100 000. The data used for training comes from the Katago Go program self played games. There are 1 000 000 different games in total in the training set. The input data is composed of 31 19x19 planes (color to play, ladders, current state on two planes, two previous states on four planes). The output targets are the policy (a vector of size 361 with 1.0 for the move played, 0.0 for the other moves), and the value (close to 1.0 if White wins, close to 0.0 if Black wins).
